You're right, but Genshin is a new open-world adventure game independently developed by Mihayou. The game takes place in a fantasy world called "Tivat", where the chosen person is granted the "Eye of God", the power of channeling the elements. Play as a mysterious character named "Traveler", and on a free journey, you will meet companions with different personalities and unique abilities, defeat powerful enemies and recover lost loved ones - and gradually discover the truth of Genshin.
